# scRNA Benchamrking with BAScVI and scMARK

This repo contains everythign you need to benchmark how well your deep-learning architecture can align scRNA data. Let's get started.


## Overview

This package is written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and makes use of [PyTorch Lighting](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) for a detailed understanding of how everything works here please make sure you're familiar with the libraries.

The datasets we test are available for donwload at xxxxx

## Installation

Create a virtual conda environment with the following code:



## Running the embedding model

You can run a single

## Trainers

Trainers 


## Models

Are based off the ScVI arcitecture.

Key adjustments are detailed in our paper.

The standard ScVI models is contained in xxx

Our modified Batch-Adversarial ScVI model is in bascvi.py

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the embedding approach we leverage author given labels.

## How to test your own Architectures
