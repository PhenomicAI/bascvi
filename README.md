This repo contains three installable modules:

pai: An API for inference of cell-type embeddings and cell-types labels from scRNA datasets - supports H5AD formats downloadable from cellxcgene

pai_soma_data: A wrapper for TileDB needed for exploring the scREF atlas we provide here on the example notebooks we provide on TileDB in the public notebooks at Phenomic/Reading from scREF and scREF-mu

ml_benchmarking: Code needed to run and evaluate ML models on teh scREF and scREF-mu banchmark
